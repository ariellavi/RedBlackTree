# Red-Black Tree
My (almost complete) attempt at implementing a Red-Black Binary Search Tree in Java. The deleteRebalance method in RBTree.java is still in progress, but all other methods function as intended. 

For more info on how a Red-Black Tree works, see RBTree-info.txt

Algorithms and info were mainly sourced from here: http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap14.htm
